          <p>
            An alum of Butler University, I graduated in 2018 as a dual major in Web Design + Development and Strategic Communication. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA, having been the top student of both of my majors and a top 15 student at the university. Since then, I worked for 2.5 years at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch headquarters in New Albany, OH as a front end web developer. I worked on seasonal and daily updates for the Abercrombie Kids brand, utilizing mainly HTML5, CSS3, Javascript ES5/6, and JQuery. I left this most recent career in mid February 2021 to spend more time on my current fullstack web development bootcamp education while I search for a fullstack position!
